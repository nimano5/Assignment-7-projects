                        <h3>My Journey</h3>
                        <p>I'm Nikitha Manoj Thomas, a graduate student at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business, where I am pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems. I previously earned my Bachelor of Science in Accounting and Digital Technology Management at Kelley with a Global Engagement Scholarship and a Direct Admit to the program for academic excellence.</p>
                        
                        <p>Professionally, I have diverse experience across tax, technology, and analytics. At Deloitte San Francisco, I prepared federal and state tax returns for partnership and private wealth clients, collaborating with the California Franchise Tax Board to ensure compliance and payment accuracy. Earlier, at Sadik and Partners and Khimji Ramdas in Oman, I streamlined accounting processes, developed dashboards to track project performance, and optimized resource allocation ‚Äî improving efficiency across multiple departments.</p>
                        
                        <p>At Indiana University, I serve as a Residential Assistant, fostering community, inclusion, and leadership among 52 residents while helping first-year students transition smoothly into college life. I've also managed Agile-based team projects, leading sprints, building wireframes, and developing responsive front-end systems using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.</p>
